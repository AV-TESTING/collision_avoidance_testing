                <p>
                    In the video, Apollo needed to drive straight across the junction. However, it seemed too confident
                    to bypass the obstacle from the right side, resulting in a collision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apollo's prediction module returns no predicted trajectory for "still" vehicles of speed less than
                    0.99 m/s (default configuration). Since the speed of the vehicle in this scenario was 0.5 m/s, no
                    predicted trajectory was generated. As a result, the planning module did not slow down since its
                    trajectory was not blocked by any obstacle or predicted traveling paths, leading to a collision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This scenario is not challenging for human drivers, as there are sufficient space and time for
                    braking to give way to the slowly moving obstacle vehicle.

                    Apollo is expected to give way or pass the slow vehicle cutting in ahead in this video.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apollo's prediction module produced a wrong predicted trajectory for the front obstacle vehicle,
                    letting Apollo believe that the vehicle maintained its lane instead of cutting into Apollo's lane.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, Apollo's planning module did not de-accelerate to give way or bypass from the left
                    side, which eventually led to the collision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Human drivers can quickly notice the cutting-in vehicle ahead and brake to give way.

                <h5 class="mt-0">Decision oscillation during lane changing</h5>
                <p>
                    In the video, Apollo first decided to overtake the slow-moving vehicle ahead. However, Apollo
                    terminated the overtaking action halfway and started to follow the vehicle on top of lane
                    boundaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Apollo 5.0, the planning module has "follow" or "stop" strategies for moving obstacles ahead in
                    the same lane and a "side-pass" strategy for static obstacles. Vehicles of speed less or equal to
                    0.5 m/s are treated as static by both the prediction module and planning module.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this case, the obstacle vehicle speed was 0.5 m/s, at the decision boundary. Due to noise, the
                    actual speed might fluctuate around 0.5m/s, causing the planning module to switch between strategies
                    for moving and static obstacles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Human drivers should be able to handle this typical overtake scenario easily.

                <h5 class="mt-0">Deadlock in a junction</h5>
                <p>
                    Apollo needed to turn left in the junction in the video, and there is an obstacle driving across and
                    meeting Apollo inside the junction. The obstacle has implemented simple collision avoidance, which
                    stops if an obstacle in front is detected. Both vehicles stopped in the junction and never moved
                    again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The case all started with an incorrect prediction result of the obstacle vehicle. The predicted
                    trajectory of the obstacle was a left-turn and did not intersect Apollo's path. As a result, Apollo
                    continued in its left-turning lane.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Apollo's prediction module realized that the obstacle vehicle was driving forward, it started
                    to brake, but it was already too late. Eventually, both vehicles came to a position where they
                    blocked each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apollo's planning module does not support "side-pass" inside junctions; thus, it cannot get out of
                    this deadlock situation by itself when its front path is blocked. The obstacle vehicle implemented
                    by Simulator does not support "side-pass" either.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A human driver would notice the incoming vehicle and brake early to give way. Even after it ends up
                    in the deadlock situation, human drivers would improvise and quickly negotiate a way out of the
                    situation.

                <h5 class="mt-0">Stop at a crosswalk to give way to a pedestrian</h5>
                <p>
                    In the video, the traffic light was green when Apollo was entering the junction. However, there was
                    a pedestrian (who could be elderly or disabled) still crossing through on the crosswalk. Apollo
                    should have braked early and come to a complete stop before the stop line (white line), even under
                    the green light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apollo considers pedestrians of speed less than 0.2m/s stationery and does not generate a prediction
                    trajectory for them. In this case, the pedestrian was crossing at 0.6 m/s, and there was a predicted
                    trajectory associated with the pedestrian. However, the prediction module only predicts 8 seconds,
                    i.e., 4.8 meters ahead of the pedestrian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The planning module will not brake when its path is clear. i.e., not blocked by other obstacles or
                    not intersected by other obstacle's predicted trajectory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, Apollo only started to brake when the pedestrian was 4.8 meters away from its planned
                    trajectory, and when it came to a full stop, it happened to stop on top of the crosswalk. Apollo
                    would have braked early if the prediction duration is longer than 8 seconds and stopped before the
                    stop line without blocking the crosswalk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Human drivers always look out for pedestrian crossing near junctions. When pedestrians are crossing,
                    human drivers must give way to pedestrians even under a green light.
